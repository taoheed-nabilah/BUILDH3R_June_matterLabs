# Build smart contract

This learning journey gave me a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract creation, deployment, and interaction. Through hands-on tasks and GitHub documentation, I gained valuable experience and built a code portfolio showcasing my understanding. I mastered the creation of ERC20 tokens, the management of blockchain-stored hashed messages, and the automation of smart contract interactions with ethers.js. Moreover, I explored zkSync and paymasters for managing transaction fees and token balances.
